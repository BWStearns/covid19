In the previous analysis by NECSI people, it is indicated that Some countries like China have shown four time-regimes for new confirmed cases (Figure 'China New Cases').

Here, I used case report data to find the changes in the country policies in those four regimes. So, I plot the day differences between onset symptoms and hospitalization of corona cases in China (Figure 'China Cases'). From the figure, it is clear that China was successful to reduce the time between onset symptoms and hospitalization of cases which incredibly helped to speed down the growth of new cases and later have fewer new cases.

The data set has information for the cases from some other countries. However, they are less than China cases (Figure 'Countries').
