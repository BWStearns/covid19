# Policy Analysis

Materials related to analyzing national and state/region/province policies and programs related to COVID-19 can be found in the database/policy-analysis folder. 

Every country has a spreadsheet where they are rated on 14 categories. 

There are detailed instructions here: [Policy Analysis Guidelines](), on the rating system and guidelines for documenting the ratings.
