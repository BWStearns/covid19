Since the first confirmed case of a new, virulent strain of the coronavirus in December in Wuhan, China, the disease has spread to 75 countries. As of March 4, 2020, there are 93,090 confirmed cases and 3,198 deaths. These numbers are still increasing.

The spread of this disease is further evidence of our warning in 2006 that high levels of global connectivity have increased the likelihood a disease outbreak growing into a pandemic. Community based care remains the best model for disease containment.
